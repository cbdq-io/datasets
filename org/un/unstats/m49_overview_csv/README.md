# UN Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49) - Overview

Sourced from <https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview>
which is an online version of _Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical
Use_ originally published as Series M, No. 49 and now commonly referred to as
the M49 standard.

See <https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/> for the full M49
methodology and for a summary of changes (the most recent of which was 2021).

This dataset was prepared by downloading the data as CSV from the UN site as
`~/Downloads/m49_overview.csv` and then using the
[dataflows](https://pypi.org/project/dataflows/) Python package to
generate the `datapackage.json` file whilst discarding
`m49_overview_csv.py`.
